### Design choices 
I designed this website to have a light pink theme to draw in my target customers. The colour is not too overpowering and leaves the recipes the center of attention on the page. 
I want the recipes to be the star of the show and everything else to be easy to read, use and works well. 

### Images 
The images on the recipes section of website are of recipes to show clearly what the recipe is at one glance, this works well for this particular website. 
The images on the utensils page are of products recommended for cooking.
